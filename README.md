# Hong Kong Horse Racing Results Prediction
## Introduction
Horse racing is one of most popular sport in Hong Kong. In last season (2020-2021) more than 137 billion HKD,  equivalent to 62 billion CAD, betting on horse racing, this is a huge bet on horse racing. This project is based on horse racing results of the last three seasons, such as  season 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and  2020-2021. In addition, create some new features and use deep learning algorithm to make predictions.

## Dataset
The source of the dataset used for training, validation and testing comes from The Hong Kong Jockey Club Club https://racing.hkjc.com/racing/information/English/Racing/LocalResults.aspx

## Tools and Packages
python

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

TensorFlow

SQLite (DB)

sql

## New Features
Based on the past three seasons (2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021), I created some new features for my model as follows:

1. Trainer’s winning rate

2. Jockey’s winning rate

3. Winning rate of different draws

4. Past performance of each horse

## Training and Testing of model

## SQL Files
Refer to link:

## Test Results
The accuracy of predicting the winning horse is 12.5%. Refer to the link for details:

## Conclusions
My model has an accuracy of 12.5%, which is acceptable. Because I only have two weeks to research and develop this project and prepare my presentation. After my presentation, I will continue to study my model to improve accuracy and make it better
