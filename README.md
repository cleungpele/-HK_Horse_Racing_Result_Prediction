# Hong Kong Horse Racing Results Prediction
## Introduction
Horse racing is of most popular sport in Hong Kong. In last season (2020-2021) more than 137 billion HKD,  equivalent to 62 billion CAD, betting on horse racing, this is a huge bet on horse racing. This project is based on horse racing results of the last three seasons, such as  season 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and  2020-2021. In addition, create some new features and use deep learning algorithm to make predictions.

## Dataset
The source of the dataset used for training, validation and testing comes from the Hong Kong Jockey Club Club https://racing.hkjc.com/racing/information/Chinese/racing/LocalResults.aspx 

## Tools and Packages
python

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

tensorflow

SQLite

sql

## New Features
Based on the past three seasons (2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021), I created some new features for my model as follows:

1. Trainer’s winning percentage 

2. Jockey’s winning percentage

3. Win percentage of different draw

4. Past performance of each horse

## Conclusions
I have two weeks to research and develop this project and prepare my presentation. After my presentation, I will continue to study my model to improve accuracy and make it better
